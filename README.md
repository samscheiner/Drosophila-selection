Data associated with the four papers from the experiment selecting on phenotypic plasticity in D. melanogaster
These are the data associated with the following four papers: 
Scheiner, S. M. and R. F. Lyman. 1989. The genetics of phenotypic plasticity. I. Heritability. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 2:95-107.
    This paper measures the heritability of plasticity of thorax length in response to temperature in the base population. 
Scheiner, S. M. and R. F. Lyman. 1991. The genetics of phenotypic plasticity. II. Response to selection. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 4:23-50.
    This paper is the response to selection.
Scheiner, S. M., R. L. Caplan, and R. F. Lyman. 1991. The genetics of phenotypic plasticity. III. Genetic correlations and fluctuating asymmetries. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 4:51-68.
    This paper measures genetic correlations for thorax length, wing length, and bristle number.
Scheiner, S. M., R. L. Caplan, and R. F. Lyman. 1989. A search for trade-offs among life history traits in Drosophila melanogaster. Evolutionary Ecology 3:51-63.
    This paper measures life history traits involving survivorship and fecundity in the base population.
